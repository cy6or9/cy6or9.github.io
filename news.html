	<p style="background-color: black; opacity: .7; text-align: center;" >2 things identified in December 2019 were the COVID-19 virus and an inbound comet named C/2019 Y4 (ATLAS). 
	Some are saying this global shutdown is an attempt to keep us indoors, afraid and distracted while this comet
	approaches our solar system. Though astronomers predict it will be closer to Mercury and will likely lose a 
	significant amount of it's mass while it makes it's pass with the sun, but what I find strange is they're not 
	predicting a specific size (AT ALL). Conspiracy theorist are on the record saying "five times the size of Jupiter" or 
	"half the size of the Sun", but I don't see a credible source making these claims. Looking at models, one showed 
	a dangerously close approach to earth and another showed ATLAS passing by mercury like experts claim (this one i 
	witnessed on a NASA site). I for sure can recall earlier this week, that they sent troops in to open the all too 
	famous doomsday bunkers meant to house the political figures and everyone else important enough to keep around for 
	our new dawn after an apocalyptic scenario. And all this during a pandemic is all too coincidental.
	We'll be able to see it with the naked eye towards the end of this month, but it's visible with a telescope now and has a 
	green aurora with a pitch black tail in the Northern hemisphere. NASA models show it closest too Earth on 5/23/2020 at a safe distance.</p>

<h2 style="background-color: black; opacity: .7; text-align: center;">DO NOT USE "Coronavirus Maps" Old Malware Repackaged!</h2>

<p style="background-color: black; opacity: .7; text-align: center;" >Incase you didn't have enough reason to be afraid of the Coronavirus, get ready for more bad news!
    It's been more than a week since Reason Cybersecurity warned of a "sophisticated attack method 
taking advantage of the trusted World Health Organization". The attack installs a keylogger onto the
system, in which it automatically records keystrokes pressed by the user. This tool is then used to 
retrieve sign in and password information that can later be used to access or even steal your accounts. 
When opened it displays a accurate geographic representation of the current spread of the COVID-19 
virus, but in the background it's collecting your cookies and running the keylogger. These cookies have 
your user-id's, passwords, browsing histories and cryptocurrencies within them. Once opened on the 
attackers end, he can see everything you don't want them too including credit card and bank information. 
Although the original Coronavirus map is safe and runnig virus free, beware of the fakes created in 
these trying times to take advantage of us. The original and virus free coronavirus map can be found at 
the following link. Be weary of others.</p>

<p style="background-color: black; opacity: .7; text-align: center;" >Although the once thought crippling disease is still on the rise, it's good to know that more people
    are recovering everyday. The disease has been reported in 116 countries, confirmed cases are 128,392 , death 
    count is above 4,728 and the amount recovered is 69,607 and all are still climbing. According to the CDC 
    (Center for Disease Control and Prevention), People with chronic diseases and older people have a higher risk 
    then most. Symptoms included are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. The virus is thought to spread through 
    person to person contact from individuals within six-feet from another. To prevent spreading the Coronavirus 
    (COVID-19), you should wash your hands, use a hand sanitizer that is more than 60% alcohol, avoid touching your 
    face (specifically your eyes, nose, and mouth), and keep distance between you and anyone who seems ill like. If 
    you're already sick you should be checked into a hospital, cover your coughs while immediately washing your 
    hands, throw used tissues in the trash, wear a mask around others, disinfect and clean any thing close-by or 
    that you come into contact with. The CDC works 24/7 to protect your health, so know that anymore travel bans 
    issued now or in the near future are solely for your safety and I urge you to abide by them to prevent further 
    spreading of this pandemic.</p>
