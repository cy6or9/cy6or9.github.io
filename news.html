<p>Incase you didn't have enough reason to be afraid of the Coronavirus, get ready for more bad news!
    It's been more than a week since Reason Cybersecurity warned of a "sophisticated attack method 
taking advantage of the trusted World Health Organization". The attack installs a keylogger onto the
system, in which it automatically records keystrokes pressed by the user. This tool is then used to 
retrieve sign in and password information that can later be used to access or even steal your accounts. 
When opened it displays a accurate geographic representation of the current spread of the COVID-19 
virus, but in the background it's collecting your cookies and running the keylogger. These cookies have 
your user-id's, passwords, browsing histories and cryptocurrencies within them. Once opened on the 
attackers end, he can see everything you don't want them too including credit card and bank information. 
Although the original Coronavirus map is safe and runnig virus free, beware of the fakes created in 
these trying times to take advantage of us. The original and virus free coronavirus map can be found at 
the following link. Be weary of others.</p>
