		<p>Hello I'm Cy6or9, Welcome to my Cyber Blogs. In my free time I'm a security specialist that tests exploits on
		myself and other colleagues to make people aware of the dangers in not practicing better security techniques. 
		Here you'll find news and some of my own twists to some major exploits, amongst other things. Feel free to bookmark

	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Simplefite</h2>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cy6or9/Simplefite/master/simplefite-menu.png" alt="description" height="300" width="400" />

	<p>Simplefite is a bash scripted gui, simplifying wifite. Each attack is set to automatically take place, simply choose a 
	selection and walk away once you see the scan taking place. Anything labeled "loop" is set to scan infinitely and wont 
	stop until you CTRL+C the xterm window. Then you can select the "cracked" option to list any networks you achieved. </p>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;"> UUO</h2>
	
	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cy6or9/uuo/master/uuo-main.png" alt="uuo-menu" height="300" width="400" />
	
	<P>UUO (Unidentified User Options) is another bash script, but this one is written to focus on keeping you anonamous. 
	It combines anonsurf, torbrowser, macchanger to help keep you hidden. It's equipped with a list of onion sites and 
	nmap to check your own ip for lose ends. This is a work in progress, so forgive the randomness for now.  I'd also like to
	move away from using anonsurf. Stay tuned for this ones development.</P>

	<h2 style="text-align: center;">Torrenting anonamously</h2>

	<p>
	DO NOT torrent copyright material while testing. Find something free and preferably big. The bigger, the more time you'll 
	have to analyze the peer and tracker list while downloading. Use a VPN that supports torrents. Know your original ip and watch the peer list
	for it. If your actual IP is shown your VPN is crap.</p>
	<p>An easier way to test it is download checkmytorrentip tool here</p>
	<p>http://checkmytorrentip.net/torrentip/checkMyTorrentIp.png.torrent</p>
	<p>watch the tracker list to see if your ip is shown.
	If you do this without seeing your actual IP, then your ready to torrent 
	anonymously. Always keep an eye on the peer list. VPNs can fail and dump 
	your ip occasionally, all depends on the VPN.
	FYI, they don't send a letter anymore warning of pirating copyright 
	material, They disconnect your whole network until you acknowledge the 
	warning on your device.</p>
